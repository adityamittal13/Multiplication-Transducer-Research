# Multiplication-Transducer 
Part of ongoing research to discover trends in multiplication transducers for different bases through data visualization and mapping quotient sets.

Important Files:
1. _C++ Implementation.cpp_ - runs graph algorithms on special multiplication transducers
2. _DFS.py_ - runs graph algorithms on special multiplication transducers
3. _networkx.py_ - checking for cycles in transducer graphs
